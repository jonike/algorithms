# Guidelines
All implementations in this git-repository adhere to the following rules/guidelines:

- Thoroughly tested (at least AC on https://open.kattis.com/).
- Everything adhere to C++11 standards.
- Compilable as is.
- Effective and optimized implementations.
- Minimalistic code and (only necessary) documentation.

If you find anything that deviates from these guidelines, please contact me at frepr183@student.liu.se.

# Detailed guideline
The implementations also adhere to the following rules:

- No typedefs (instead use "using").
- Don't use unnecessary "using".
- Don't use '#include "bits/stdc++.h"'.
- No #define x (instead use const x or constexpr x).
